# simple-react-native
Simple "course goal todo list" mobile app

This is a react native project that I learned from Udemy. 
In this course, it is very simple as I just create components to input a text and add it to show on the screen.
The main purpose is to know how to style in react native. 
My code is not exactly the same as my instructor as some of the code is written by myself to make it looks nicer.

The user will be able to add new goal and the modal will pop up. 
The user can delete the goal by clicking on it. 
The user won't be able to add nothing or space.
